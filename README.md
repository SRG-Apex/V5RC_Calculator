# v5rc Calculator 

Current Version 0.B.1

**Purpose: To create a fully featured match and skills calculator to be used in competitions to verify scores**

Why? 
I personally got fed up of VRC hub's wifi dependence and lack of native skills mode, making calculating scores quickly somewhat difficult, and with the complex skills rules in this year's challenge VRC High Stakes, we see a need for a completely offline calculator

How to Install?
Eventually we hope to eventually have it available on Fdroid, or at least an APK, but for now as it's in very early stages of development. 

Will it be coming to IOS? 
As of right now No, Apple's closed source policies can make it difficult to get apps like this approved for the App Store, but as it's open source i'm sure there is a was of side loading it onto IOS devices

Planned Features: 
- Saving Scores (And the ability to attatch links to videos or other sources, making studying matches really easy)
- Vex U
- Built in Game Manual
